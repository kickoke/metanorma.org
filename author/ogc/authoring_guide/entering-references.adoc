References are an integral part of standards. The main mechanism for references are anchors and destinations. There are four types of references:

* Hyperlinks to an external source, for example a link to a website
* Metadata references
* Internal references to a section, image, table, etc.
* link:author/topics/sections/entering_bib.adoc[Bibliographic entries]

== Hyperlinks

AsciiDoc lets you include links to external sources, and sources to files within the same project.

To reference an *internal* source:

. Use the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/link-macro/[link macro] to include a link to a file. The syntax looks like this: `\link:PATH[]`.
. Add link text in square brackets after the path.
+

To reference an *external* source:

. Paste the URL into the document.
. Add link text in square brackets after the URL (optional) `URL[Link text]`. 
+

== Metadata references

Every document contains a set of metadata to describe the document. You can insert a metadata reference by putting the attribute in curly braces `{attribute}`. The reference will be replaced with the value in the rendered output.

== Internal references

To link to an important section, table, figure, formula, or list item in your document:

. Set an anchor using double square brackets before the content you want to reference: `\[[anchor]]`. 
+

.Typical gelatinization curve 
image::images/rice_image2.png[Image of the gelatinization curve] 
----
+
.Rendered image caption

. To reference an anchor, type the anchor name like this `\<<anchor>>`.
+

. To set an alternative text other than the anchor text, append the text inside the brackets using a comma.

=== Auto-numbering of references
Metanorma automatically numbers and names references; because they are autonumbered, they will be renumbered automatically if you insert any new text of the same type. 

Since the markup will be converted into XML, the anchor must follow the https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/[XML namespace conventions]. Therefore, an anchor name name must not contain:

* colons
* whitespaces
* words starting with numbers
